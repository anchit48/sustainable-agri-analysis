## Description: 
Purpose of this case-study is to identify the important markets across the Globe, that has a high agricultural participation and produces most of the cereal in the world. Based on the World Bank Data, we have generated the country specific production metrics in terms of the Data Features that exists in #Data Description
## Objective: 
To extract actionable insights that will enable Business growth in terms of Fertilizer Production & Optimization

## Key Questions:
1. What are the different features that affects the Fertilizer usage?
2. Are there any Economic factors that drives the Cereal Production?
3. Trend analysis of the countries having high Agricultural usage and Cereal Production

## Data Description:

## Data:

**Fertilizer consumption (% of fertilizer production)** 

**Fertilizer consumption (kilograms per hectare of arable land)**

**Agricultural land (% of land area**

**Arable land (hectares per person)**

**Agricultural irrigated land (% of total agricultural land)**

**Average precipitation in depth (mm per year)**

**Cereal production (metric tons)**

**Cereal yield (kg per hectare)**

**Access to electricity, rural (% of rural population)**

**Agricultural nitrous oxide emissions (% of total)**

**Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP)**

**Employment in agriculture (% of total employment) (modeled ILO estimate)**

**Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (current US$)**

# **Conclusion and Recommendations**

## Conclusion

* We analyzed a dataset of nearly 2.4K observations with almost 66 Countries/Region spread around 9 years from 2010-2018

* The features of interest here is the "Fertilizer Consumption", "Cereal Yield", "Agricultural Land" & "Arable Land"  

We are able to conclude that 

1. Fertilizer consumption (% of fertilizer production) has been cyclic with a downward trend in early 2010 and upward trend till 2015 and then declined again.
2. Cereal production (metric tons) have been steadily increasing till 2017 with a marginal decline in 2018
3. Cereal yield (kg per hectare) have seen a healthy growth after 2012 onwards.
4. Agricultural land (% of land area) have been on a downward trajectory.
5. Arable land (hectares per person) have been seeing a steep decline as well.
6. Uruguay has the highest mean Agricultural Land over the last 9 years followed by Saudi, Kazahistan, South Africa & Burundi
7. Estonia has the Highest Fertilizer Consumption followed by Uruguay, Sri Lanka, Thailand & Philippines in the last 9 years.
8. UAE, Kuwait, Oman, Belgium & Netherlands have the highest Cereal Yield.
9. OECD, East Asia & Pacific, China, Europe & Central Asia shows the largest Cereal Production
10. Burundi, Somalia, Malawi, Chad & Niger are the top 5 Countries having the Highest Employment in Agricultural sector.


## Recommendation to business

1. Since "Fertilizer consumption" usage have been sporadic, may be Business should focus on "organic" ways to ensure high "Cereal Yield".
2. "Australia", "Canada", "Argentina" have the largest "Arable Land" which means that they remain one of the most potential market to target from the "agricultural aspect"
3. Asian countries have highest "Cereal Production" but lower "Cereal Yield", that means there is a hidden opportunity to sell off more "Organic Fertilizer"
4. Since African regions and countries have one of the highest "Agricultural Economy", these can again be one of the potential customers.
5. Usage of "Fertilizers" have been declined significantly in "Estonia", may be Business needs to check the pricing structure or keep a close watch on the quality.
6. UAE has the highest Cereal Yield, despite not being the largest "Fertilizer" consumer. May be worth exploring the nature of treatment/application they are utilising.

##  Further Analysis

1. Adding the missing values such as "Precipitation", "Emissions" can further enhance the feature relationship which would be interesting to explore
2. Adding few more data points like "Organic" v/s "Non-Organic" Fertilizer usage, Weather conditions and population count.
